        <h2>What is Fire Safety?</h2>
        <p>Fire safety is the set of practices intended to reduce the destruction caused by fire. Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent ignition of an uncontrolled fire, and those that are used to limit the development and effects of a fire after it starts.

        <h1>Fire Extinguisher</h1>
        <h2>What is a Fire Extinguisher?</h2>

        <p>A fire extinguisher is an <b>active fire protection</b> device used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations. It is not intended for use on an <b>out-of-control fire</b>, such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the <b>expertise of a fire brigade.</b> </p>

        <h2>How does a Fire Extinguisher Work?</h2>

        <p>Fire extinguishers work by removing one of the three elements necessary for fire to occur: <b>fuel, heat, or oxygen.</b> The most common type of fire extinguisher uses a chemical agent to remove the fuel from the fire triangle. The agent is typically a <b>dry chemical</b>, which smothers the fire by chemically reacting with the <b>combustible materials</b> to produce a <b>non-combustible compound</b>, depriving the fire of fuel. </p>
        
        <h2>What are the different types of Fire Extinguishers?</h2>

        <p>There are five main types of fire extinguishers: <b>Water, Foam, Dry Chemical(ABC powder), Carbon Dioxide, and Wet Chemical.</b> Each type of extinguisher is designed to fight a specific type of fire. <b>Water extinguishers</b> are designed to fight <b>Class A fires. Foam extinguishers</b> are designed to fight <b>Class A, B fires. Dry Chemical extinguishers</b> are designed to fight <b>Class A, B, C and Electrical fires. </b><b>Carbon Dioxide extinguishers</b> are designed to fight <b>Class B, and Electrical fires.</b> <b>Dry Chemical extinguishers</b> are designed to fight <b>Class A, and Cooking oils fires.</b> </p>

        <h2>How do I use a Fire Extinguisher?</h2>

        <p>Fire extinguishers are designed to be used by anyone. However, it is important to know how to use a fire extinguisher before a fire occurs. The first step is to identify the type of fire you are dealing with. The second step is to know which is the appropriate fire extinguisher to extinguish the fire. The third step is to know how to activate and use the fire extinguisher properly.</p>

        <h2>Chemistry behind the Fire Extinguisher?</h2>

        <p>Depending on its intended application, a fire extinguisher may be infused with a variety of chemicals.</p>
        <div style="padding-left:40px;width:90%;display:flex;padding:40px;">
            <ul style="padding:30px;width:60%;">
                <li>ABC (Dry Chemical) Fire Extinguisher</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the main compound in this fire extinguisher is monoammonium phosphate, which comes out as yellow power, which helps in distinguishing it from other non-multipurpose fire extinguisher. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Water Fire Extinguisher</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It only requires a standard ground water line hookup from the government or a local fire hydration pump to get a water jet spray. It is best suited for longer distances whereas water spray units offer a more controllable spray action but are too close to one other.</li>
                </ul>   
                <li>Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguisher</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally has a strong acid and a hydro-carbonate(like NaHCO3), which when reacted, releases CO2 as byproduct. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Wet Chemical Fire Extinguisher</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wet chemical fire extinguishers are filled with potassium, which cools and lowers the temperature of the fire, therefore stopping the fire from spreading. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Foam Fire Extinguisher</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foam fire extinguishers are primarily water-based, hence they work similarly to water-based extinguishers to put out fires by reducing temperature. Additionally, it includes AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam), which smothers fires and seals in flammable vapours. This stops the flames from re-igniting.. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <h2>How do I maintain a Fire Extinguisher?</h2>
        
        <p>Fire extinguishers are a piece of equipment that may save lives, they should be checked by a professional on a regular basis and maintained once a year. </p>

        <h2>How do I dispose/recycle of a Fire Extinguisher?</h2>
        
        <p>The three safest ways to get rid of a fire extinguisher are to recycle it when it's empty, give it to the fire department, or take it to a specific disposal site. If the extinguisher's canister is empty, recycle it.</p>

        <h2>History of Fire Extinguisher?</h2>
        
        <p>The first fire extinguisher was invented by the British inventor Captain George William Manby in 1819, it was a vessel containing 3 gallons of pearl ash solution under compressed air pressure. Before fire extinguishers, Roman's in 16th century were using sand-bucket as a method to extinguish fire.</p>
