        <h3>This project combines computer science technologies with ideas from chemistry. I attempt to discuss several safety precautions that should be observed in the chemistry field in this effort. such as general safety, and fire safety. Pupils in general, including elementary and secondary students, were the target audience for this project. Since students will eventually utilize equipment or participate in experiments that need them to observe this safety, it is crucial to inculcate in their knowledge and comprehension of the many types of safety.</h3>
